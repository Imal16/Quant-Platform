# Quant-Platform

This is a public breakdwon of one of my projects. I do not think I will making the code public at the moment.
Essentially my goal is build a quant platform that is similar to the Bloomberg Terminal. In essence it will aggregate data from multiple sources and allow the user to analyze Financial Information. This is an ambitious project and will take time. This repository will summarize any major milestones I hit througout building this projet.

### Motivation

My motiation for this project is pretty simple, I have a passion in the financial markets and this project allows me to combine my technical abilities and passsion to create a fun project. Secondly, there is so many different ideas that can be implemented. 

For example, I took a Data Analysis in Economic course which main focus is working with time series data and the various implications of it such as hetergeneity, cointegration, NonStationary Timeseries, and autocorrelation. We also touched on various models such as OLS, Geometric Lag models, GLS, ARDL, ARCH, GARCH, and VAR models. I also took an Econometrics course which covers different regression techniques in depth for timeseries data. (Hypothesis testing, cofidence intervals, p-values, and different test-statistics (F-test, T-test, Chi-Square) were a constantly used in both course).

I can take the topics covered in the non Computer Science course I took and implement in this project.

Another Set of ideas can be the use of AI and ML, like using NLP on news or social media, working with various model to try prediicions ( LTSM, Neural Nets,Random Forest, Linear Regression etc...)

Collecion and anlysis of Alternative data can be another idea to be implemented in this project. Use of calculus, stochastic calculus, Financial Derivative modeling, Probabliity and Statistics concepts are other ideas as well.

Eventually, it would be cool to be able to migrate and use cloud technology as well, but first I would like a proper working product.

As you can see this project offers almost endless ideas and allows me to work and learn various topics. I had already read a couple research paper, and am fortunate enough to have accumulated various excellent reading pieces to help me.

### Tech Stack

Currently, I am using a Python back-end. For the Front-end I am simiplifying my life a bit by using Plotly Dash to create the Dashboard. This allows me to use Python to interact with the Dashboard and use HTML to shape it and CSS to style it. 


Both Git and Github are being used, and certain APIs are being used to obtain data.

##### Significant Python Packages Used

Pandas, Numpy, NLTK,

## MILESTONES

### Using Alternative Data

#### Sept. 9, 2020
I am currently working on an alternative data source which requires webscrapping/parsing through a social media platform. I am currently not finished with this part of the project yet. Currently I am having trouble thinking of a way to fully grasp the necessay data. The reason is with social media post, there is various slang being used, different syntax and different ways of writing the same message. I am using the NLTK package to clean and parse through the data, but also want to find a more effective way of doing so since one 'parse' collects thousandx of post and comments, meaning you can have around 10,000 words.



At this point I do not have pictures or gif, however, in the future, when there is further progress in the project I would like to add some.
